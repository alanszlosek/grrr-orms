Introduction
====

A few times a year I end up thinking about ORM (ActiveRecord) variations. This is where they're all going to live. Maybe if I convert the ideas to code they'll stop haunting me ...

Check out the 'three' folder for the latest variation. It makes common CRUD operations a snap, allows you to "chain" through to related objects, and gets out of your way when you need to write SQL.

Requirements
====

* PHP 5.3 and later
* My dbFacile project

Requirements: Since it leverages the great late static binding capabilities found in PHP 5.3 and later.
